This project is about a tanker that shoots canon-balls at the targets (3 bouncy balls).
The up and down arrow keys move the aiming device of the tanker, but the tanker is not evolved enough to shoot yet.
Click the right arrow key to see through the tanker and notice the presence of the reloaded canon ball, and click any other key to stop seeing through the tanker.
